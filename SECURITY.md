## Reporting a Vulnerability

Here's how to report any security vulnerabilities:

Please direct all vulnerability reports to [email address or bug tracker]. We strive to promptly address all reported vulnerabilities. You can expect an initial acknowledgment within [timeframe]. 

Once a vulnerability is reported, our security team will investigate its severity and potential impact. If the vulnerability is accepted, we will provide regular updates on the progress of the fix. If the vulnerability is declined, we will provide justification and, if possible, recommendations for mitigation.

Thank you for helping us maintain the security of our project.
